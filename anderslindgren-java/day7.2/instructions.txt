--- Part Two ---

You would also like to know which IPs support SSL (super-secret listening).

An IP supports SSL if it has an Area-Broadcast Accessor, or ABA, anywhere in
the supernet sequences (outside any square bracketed sections), and a corresponding
Byte Allocation Block, or BAB, anywhere in the hypernet sequences.
An ABA is any three-character sequence which consists of the same character
twice with a different character between them, such as xyx or aba.
A corresponding BAB is the same characters but in reversed positions: yxy and bab, respectively.

For example:

aba[bab]xyz supports SSL (aba outside square brackets with corresponding bab within square brackets).
xyx[xyx]xyx does not support SSL (xyx, but no corresponding yxy).
aaa[kek]eke supports SSL (eke in supernet with corresponding kek in hypernet;
the aaa sequence is not related, because the interior character must be different).
zazbz[bzb]cdb supports SSL (zaz has no corresponding aza, but zbz has a
corresponding bzb, even though zaz and zbz overlap).

How many IPs in your puzzle input support SSL?
