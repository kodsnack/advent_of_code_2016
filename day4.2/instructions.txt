--- Part Two ---

With all the decoy data out of the way, it's time to decrypt this list and get moving.

The room names are encrypted by a state-of-the-art shift cipher,
which is nearly unbreakable without the right software. However,
the information kiosk designers at Easter Bunny HQ were not expecting
to deal with a master cryptographer like yourself.

To decrypt a room name, rotate each letter forward through the alphabet
a number of times equal to the room's sector ID.
A becomes B, B becomes C, Z becomes A, and so on. Dashes become spaces.

For example, the real name for qzmt-zixmtkozy-ivhz-343 is very encrypted name.

What is the sector ID of the room where North Pole objects are stored?
